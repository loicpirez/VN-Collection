## Library

### Filters & search ✅
Status chips, free-text title search, tag / language / year filters, tri-state
"more filters" (matched-VNDB, matched-EGS, fan-disc, favourite, has-notes,
NSFW, nukige…). All state lives in URL params so the back button works.

### Sort + custom drag-reorder ✅
Standard sort dropdown plus an opt-in `sort=custom` mode that unlocks
drag-to-reorder via @dnd-kit. Reset button reverts to the default sort.
Whole-card drag surface (no separate handle) — clicks pass through
to the underlying `<Link>` and the heart / lists overlays because the
PointerSensor has a 6 px activation distance. Honors the comfortable /
dense toggle in custom-order mode as well.

### Four-way playtime model ✅
Three real playtime sources — VNDB community length, EGS user-review
median, and the user's own recorded time — used to render as three
disconnected inline labels with no source-priority story. Now there
are four sort keys + one card display:

- `playtime`          — user's own recorded time, no fallback.
- `length_minutes`    — VNDB length only.
- `egs_playtime`      — EGS median only.
- `combined_playtime` — average of every populated source. The SQL
  divides by `populated_count` so a single-source value ranks at its
  own magnitude rather than getting watered down by missing data.
  Example: VNDB 95 + EGS 90 + Mine 93 → (95+90+93)/3 = 92.67.

On `/vn/[id]` a `PlaytimeCompare` component shows all four columns
with "Use" buttons that write `source_pref.playtime` (was dead code).
Every `VnCard` shows the **All** combined value as the primary
playtime chip with the per-source breakdown beneath and a tooltip
listing each source.

### Quick-actions on cards ✅
Right-click a tile → menu with status change, favourite toggle, "open
detail page", "open producer", "filter by this producer". All actions hit
existing `PATCH /api/collection/[id]`.

### Random pick / wheel ✅
Dice button next to the bulk-download CTA. Picks uniformly from whatever
the current filters resolve to and navigates to the chosen VN.

### Saved filter combos ✅
"Pin" the current filter URL as a named preset. The preset chips appear
above the filter bar so you can jump between common views ("ja completed
≥85", "wishlist fully translated", "nukige to dump") in one click.

### Dense view toggle ✅
Compact 5-column layout sharing the same card data, switchable from the
toolbar. Useful for users with very large libraries.

### Multi-select + comparison ✅
Select mode lets the user check 2–4 entries; the "Compare" CTA opens
`/compare?ids=…` rendering them side-by-side with shared values
highlighted.

### Anniversary feed ✅
Home-page widget surfacing "this VN released N years ago today" for
entries in your collection — small enough to ignore, sticky enough to
notice when something notable lines up.

### Wishlist controls ✅
`/wishlist` mirrors your VNDB "Wishlist" label and adds:
  - **Filter** by free-text query (title / alt / developer).
  - **Sort** by added date (newest/oldest), title, rating, release date,
    or length.
  - **Group** by year, developer, language, or "already in collection
    vs. to acquire".
  - **Hover-remove** on entries already in your collection — a small
    `HeartOff` button appears on hover and deletes that entry from the
    VNDB wishlist (other labels and your vote stay intact).
  - **Multi-select** + bulk delete for sweeping the list.
  - Loading shows a skeleton card grid; the "list is empty" copy only
    appears post-resolve.

### Universal Lists ✅
Free-form user-curated groupings independent of status / series / tags.
A VN can be in any number of lists. Schema:

```sql
user_list(id, name, slug UNIQUE, description, color, icon,
          pinned BOOL, created_at, updated_at)
user_list_vn(list_id FK, vn_id, order_index, added_at, note,
             PRIMARY KEY(list_id, vn_id))
```

`user_list_vn.vn_id` deliberately has **no FK** to `vn(id)` so
anticipated / wishlist entries that aren't yet in the `vn` table can
still be tracked.

Routes: `GET /api/lists`, `POST /api/lists`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE
/api/lists/[id]`, `POST/DELETE /api/lists/[id]/items`,
`GET /api/vn/[id]/lists`.

UI:
  - `/lists` overview — grid of cards with color, name, description,
    VN count. Hover any card for the ⋮ menu (Pin / Rename / Delete).
    Create form at the top with name + description + 8-preset color
    picker.
  - `/lists/[id]` detail — header with metadata editor (rename, recolor,
    delete), add-VN form (`v123` / `egs_456`), and a VnCard grid for
    every member with hover X to remove from the list.
  - `ListsPickerButton` on every `VnCard` — lazy popover with search,
    every existing list as a checkbox, inline "create new list" input,
    live count chip when the VN belongs to ≥ 1 list. Optimistic toggles.
  - `VnListMemberships` chips under the VN detail title — one per list
    membership, colored by the list, click to open the list, X to remove.

### Favorite hover toggle ✅
`FavoriteToggleButton` renders as an overlay heart on every `VnCard`
(top-left) and as an inline pill in the VN detail action bar. The
overlay is **always tappable** (no `hidden sm:inline` traps — mobile
and tablet are first-class). Filled red when favorited, hover-revealed
outline otherwise. Auto-adds a search hit to the collection (status =
planning) before flipping the favorite if the VN isn't already tracked.
Optimistic update with rollback on error.

### Cover source picker ✅
`CoverSourcePicker` is a modal triggered from the VN detail action bar
that lets the user pick the cover from three categorical sources:
  1. **VNDB** — `DELETE /api/collection/[id]/cover` (revert to default).
  2. **EGS** — `POST {source:'url', value:'/api/egs-cover/<egs_id>'}`.
  3. **Custom** — file upload (multipart), URL input, *or* pick from
     a thumbnail grid of every screenshot + per-release artwork
     attached to this VN (each tile is a one-click "set as cover").

The current pick is ring-highlighted so it's obvious which image is
live. Initial tab is inferred from `currentCustomCover` (EGS URL →
EGS tab, anything else → Custom tab, null → VNDB tab).

---

## Per-VN detail page

### Developers + Publishers ✅
VNDB distinguishes between **developer** (the studio that made the VN)
and **publisher** (the company that publishes / localizes a release).
We mirror both:
- Developers come from `/vn { developers{...} }` and live in
  `vn.developers` (JSON).
- Publishers are aggregated from every release's `release.producers[]`
  where `publisher = true`, deduped by id and persisted to
  `vn.publishers` (JSON). VNDB only exposes the role at the release
  level, so the release-mirror pipeline (`ensureLocalImagesForVn` →
  `fetchAndDownloadReleaseImages`) populates them — meaning every
  add, refresh, and bulk re-download path keeps publishers fresh.
- The library filter accepts both `?producer=p123` (developer side)
  and `?publisher=p123` (publisher side) as **separate** params so
  a producer credited under both roles still shows up correctly per
  side.
- /vn/[id] renders a "Publishers" row right under the developer
  compare. Each publisher chip links to `/producer/[id]`.
- `/producers` ranking is developer-only on purpose (the page is
  "studios behind VNs I own"). Publisher-only producers reach their
  page through publisher chips and the `?publisher` filter.

### Sources comparison (VNDB / EGS) ✅
Synopsis / cover / brand / etc. each surface a tab toggle. Per-field
"Set as default" pins the user's preferred side, otherwise auto-resolve
picks VNDB first then falls back to EGS.

### View on VNDB + View on EGS ✅
The action bar on `/vn/[id]` carries a "View on VNDB" external link
and, when the VN has an EGS row linked, **also** a "View on EGS"
link — both visible simultaneously so the user can jump to either
upstream page in one click. EGS-only synthetic entries only show
the EGS button (no VNDB id to link to).

### Graceful producer page ✅
`/producer/[id]` no longer hard-404s when the VNDB fetch fails AND
nothing is cached locally. Falls back to deriving a name from any
in-collection VN that credits the producer (developer or publisher),
so the page still shows the user's owned VNs and the producer chip
they navigated from. The global not-found template is now wording-
generic ("Page not found"), no longer "VN not found", because it
fires for every notFound() across the app.

### Custom synopsis ✅
Write your own description. Overrides VNDB / EGS by default with a
"Show VNDB / EGS" toggle to peek at the originals.

### Reading speed estimator ✅
"VNDB: 16h · EGS: 12h · You: ≈14h (×0.88)" line under the VNDB length.
Multiplier is the median of (personal playtime / community length) over
your completed entries, activated at 3 samples.

### Tag co-occurrence ✅
Tags from other VNs in the collection that share at least one tag with
this one. Bars sized by overlap count; hidden when the collection is too
small to produce signal.

### "Similar to this VN" page ✅
Reuses the recommendation engine seeded by a single VN's top tags.
Available via a "More like this" link in the relations area.

### Activity timeline ✅
Per-VN journal of status changes, playtime, rating, started/finished
dates and manual notes. Manual notes can be deleted; auto entries are
immutable. Schema: `vn_activity(id, vn_id, kind, payload JSON,
occurred_at)`.

### Cast (VA) ✅
Character thumbnails linked to `/character/[id]`; VA name linked to
`/staff/[id]`. Sourced from `vn_va_credit` populated at upsert time.

### Staff ✅
Production credits grouped by role (scenario, art, music, …). Each name
links to its staff page. Visiting `/staff/[id]` for the first time
auto-downloads the full VNDB credit list (every VN + character that
person worked on, cached 30 days) and surfaces the ones outside your
collection under a "More credits" section. The download streams in
behind a `<Suspense>` skeleton — locally-known credits paint instantly.

### Series auto-detect ✅
When the VN's VNDB relations include other in-collection entries, the
detail page surfaces a card proposing "Join series X" or "Create series
Y" with a name derived from the longest common prefix. The graph is
walked transitively (BFS over seq / preq / set / fan / alt / orig) so a
3+ volume chain like "Ai Kiss 1 → 2 → 3" all surfaces from any entry
point. Clicking "Join existing" or "Create new" joins every transitively-
related VN in your collection in one shot.

### Series metadata editor ✅
`/series/[id]` carries an inline editor for the series name, free-form
description, cover image, and banner image. Uploads stream through
`POST /api/series/[id]/image` (multipart, 15 MB cap) and land in
`data/storage/series/` with the relative path stored in
`series.cover_path` / `series.banner_path`. The page header renders the
banner as a hero strip plus the cover thumbnail.

### Routes ✅
Per-VN ordered list of routes (e.g. "Saber → Rin → Sakura") with completion
tracking and free-form notes.

### Per-route notes ✅
Each route entry has a sticky-note toggle that expands an inline textarea
(up to 2000 chars). Notes render below the row as italic muted text when
collapsed, and the row shows a filled accent icon when notes are present.
Completion dates are stamped automatically the first time a route is
marked complete.

### Smart status hint ✅
Non-intrusive banner: "you've logged ≥ VNDB length — mark as completed?"
when `playtime_minutes >= length_minutes` and status is `playing`.

### Banner + custom cover ✅
Upload a banner image and position its focal point with a drag pin.
Custom cover overrides both VNDB and EGS posters.

### Owned editions ✅
Track every physical / digital copy: location, edition label, box type,
condition, price paid, currency, acquired date, **purchase place**
(store name / URL / second-hand seller — full provenance), photos.

### Pomodoro timer ✅
25-minute timer with a one-click "log to playtime". Adds an activity
entry automatically. Toggles from the playtime row on the detail page.

Now publishes its live elapsed-minute count via the `SessionPanel`
wrapper so siblings (the Game log) can stamp notes with the running
session length.

### Game log ✅
Free-form timestamped journal per VN, distinct from the activity log
(which records state changes). Schema:

```sql
vn_game_log(id, vn_id FK, note TEXT, logged_at INTEGER,
            session_minutes INTEGER NULL, created_at, updated_at)
```

UI lives next to the Pomodoro (inside `SessionPanel`). Composer with
⌘/Ctrl + Enter to submit, live character counter (8000 max), optional
"attach Xm of active session" chip when the timer is running. Entries
are grouped by day with localized headers, sorted newest-first, with
hover-revealed Edit / Delete and a session-minute chip when stamped.

Routes: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/collection/[id]/game-log`.

## Discovery

### Recommendations from VNDB tags ✅
`/recommendations` — surfaces VNs you don't own that share tags with your
highest-rated entries. Weighted by user_rating; tag matches scored and
ranked. Toggle for including ero tags.

### Upcoming releases ✅
`/upcoming` — three tabs to choose your scope of "what's next":
  - **My collection** (default): future releases from producers already in
    your collection, grouped by month. When VNDB returns `vns[].image=null`,
    the page overlays the local DB cover (image_url/image_thumb/local_image)
    so collection items always render a poster even for unreleased entries.
  - **EGS anticipated**: top-100 games on ErogameScape ranked by user
    purchase intent (`必ず購入 / 多分購入 / 様子見` counts) with a VNDB
    cross-link per row when EGS records one. Cards lay out 2-per-row
    with big 128×192 covers (152×224 on sm+) so the cover is actually
    visible. For rows carrying a `vndb_id` the cover is fetched
    directly from VNDB via one batched call (`fetchVnCovers(ids)`);
    everything else falls through `/api/egs-cover/[id]` (see "EGS
    cover resolver" below). Big rank chip on each card (h-8 w-8),
    bold intent counters with muted labels.
  - **All VNDB**: every upcoming release VNDB tracks in the next 12 months.

Each tab body streams in via `<Suspense>` with a skeleton placeholder so
the page header + tab strip paint immediately.

### EGS cover resolver ✅
`GET /api/egs-cover/[id]` — tiered resolution chain (first hit wins):
  1. `gamelist.banner_url` (curated EGS banner, trusted — no probe).
  2. **Linked VNDB cover** via `egs_game.vn_id` → `vn.image_url` (or
     local mirror at `/api/files/<local_image>`). Best quality + most
     reliable for anticipated entries.
  3. **Probed** `egs:image.php?game=<id>` — single GET with Range
     header, 3.5 s timeout.
  4. First available shop URL — Suruga-ya / DMM / DLsite / Gyutto.

**Server-side proxy, not 302 redirect.** For any off-origin target the
route fetches the upstream bytes and streams them back with a clean
`Content-Type` + a `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, swr=604800`
header. Same-origin `/api/files/<path>` targets still 302-redirect
(no extra bandwidth). Proxying sidesteps the referer / mixed-content /
Cloudflare bot-mitigation failures that were silently breaking the
browser fetch when the route 302'd cross-origin.

Hits cache for 7 days. Misses cache for 1 hour (down from 24 h) so
freshly-published banners surface inside the hour. The global
`POST /api/refresh/global` busts every `egs:cover-resolved:*` row so
users can force re-resolution.

### Anticipated covers via VNDB direct ✅
`/upcoming?tab=anticipated` server-component calls
`fetchVnCovers(ids)` once after `fetchEgsAnticipated`, batching every
anticipated row's `vndb_id` into a single VNDB POST. The card then
renders the high-quality VNDB poster URL inline (with the correct
`sexual` flag for NSFW gating) instead of bouncing through the EGS
resolver. EGS-only rows (no `vndb_id`) fall back to `/api/egs-cover/`.

### Cross-VN quotes ✅
`/quotes` — every quote across every VN you've fetched, with character +
VN attribution and a free-text filter. Random-quote footer pulls from
this pool too.

---

## Stats & insights

### `/stats` overview ✅
Total VNs, total playtime, by-status counts, top tags, by-year histogram,
top languages / platforms / locations / editions.

### Score distribution vs VNDB ✅
Histogram of your `user_rating` overlaid on the VNDB community curve for
the same VNs.

### Best ROI ranking ✅
`user_rating / playtime_minutes` sorted descending — your highest-density
wins. Hidden until you have ≥ 5 completed entries.

### Year in review ✅
`/year` — yearly bar chart of completions, total hours, top genres, score
average. Picks the active year from a query param; defaults to the
current calendar year.

### Activity heatmap ✅
GitHub-style 12-month calendar of activity entries (any kind), colour
intensity ≡ daily count. Lives on the year-in-review page.

### Producer completion % ✅
For each developer in your collection, show "you own N/M of their
releases" via VNDB. Missing entries listed underneath with a one-click
"Add to collection" affordance.

### Genre evolution ✅
Yearly stack of your top tags by year-you-completed — visualises taste
drift over time.

### Reading goals ✅
"Finish N VNs in 2026" — set a yearly target, see a progress ring on
`/stats` with projected end date based on your speed multiplier.

---

## Data management

### `/data` page ✅
Hub for everything that touches the file-system: VNDB token, bulk asset
download status, exports, imports, backups.

### JSON / CSV / ICS export ✅
- JSON — round-trippable backup.
- CSV — one flat row per VN, arrays joined with `; `.
- ICS — RFC 5545 calendar with a VEVENT per `started_date` and
  `finished_date`.

### JSON / .db import ✅
JSON merges (existing rows updated, new rows added). A `.db` upload
fully replaces the current database. Drag-and-drop on the `/data` page
triggers the same flow.

### Duplicate detector ✅
Scans the collection for entries that share normalised title prefixes
across VNDB and EGS-only synthetic ids, surfacing potential variants to
merge or remove.

### Stale-data wizard ✅
Lists VNs whose `fetched_at` is older than the configured threshold,
plus rows with broken EGS links or missing covers. One-click bulk
refresh.

### Backup (`.db`) ✅
Raw SQLite dump for cold backup.

### Cache panel ✅
Inspect the VNDB cache by prefix; purge expired or selective entries.

---

## Settings

### Content controls hub ✅ (closed-eye icon)
The eye icon in the navbar opens a compact popover that exposes every
"what shows on screen" preference in one place:
- **Spoiler level** (0 / 1 / 2 — matches VNDB's site preference,
  filters tags / traits / character meta across the app)
- **Hide all images** globally
- **Blur R18** imagery
- **Hide sexual images** as a hard filter
- **NSFW threshold** slider (0–2, 0.1 steps)
- **Show sexual traits** on character pages
- "All settings…" button dispatches a `vn:open-settings` `CustomEvent`
  that `SettingsButton` listens for to open the canonical modal

The eye icon switches between `Eye` (any non-default gate active) and
`EyeOff` (everything locked down) so the user can read their current
posture at a glance. State is mirrored to localStorage + cookie by
`DisplaySettingsProvider`.

### Full settings modal ✅ (gear icon)
`SettingsButton` opens a modal portal (escapes the header stacking
context) with every content-controls toggle mirrored, plus:
- **VNDB token** (paste from <https://vndb.org/u/tokens>) + writeback
  + status pull + fan-out toggle + backup URL
- **Steam** Web API key + 64-bit SteamID
- **Random quote source** — all VNDB or only from your collection
- **Default sort** for the library
- **Original title first** (swap headline ↔ subtitle)
- **Prefer local images** (read from `/api/files/` instead of remote
  CDNs when a mirror exists)

### Per-page Refresh button + freshness chip ✅
`RefreshPageButton` renders on the pages whose render genuinely
depends on a remote cache: **`/upcoming`**, **`/tags`**, **`/traits`**.
The button:
- Reads `lastUpdatedAt` server-side via `getCacheFreshness(patterns)`
  — `SELECT MAX(fetched_at) FROM vndb_cache WHERE cache_key LIKE …`.
  Patterns anchor on the actual key format `{METHOD} {path}|{METHOD}|{hash}`
  (e.g. `'% /tag|%'`, `'tag_full:%'`, `'anticipated:%'`).
- Renders a tiered relative-time chip ("Data Xh ago") via the shared
  `timeAgo()` util. `now` defaults to `lastUpdatedAt` on the server so
  the SSR first paint reads "just now" instead of a raw timestamp;
  the client useEffect re-syncs to `Date.now()` and ticks every 30 s.
- Turns the chip red when stale (never downloaded or > 7 d).
- Hidden when `lastUpdatedAt` is `undefined` (the prop is omitted).
  Pages with purely-local SQL (`/stats`, `/data`, `/producers`) don't
  carry the chip — a freshness reading there would be meaningless.
- Clicking Refresh calls `POST /api/refresh/global`, which **busts the
  relevant cache rows first** (`egs:cover-resolved:%`, `anticipated:%`,
  `% /stats|%`, `% /schema|%`, `% /authinfo|%`, `% /release|%`,
  `% /release:%`, `% /producer|%`, `% /producer:%`, `% /tag|%`,
  `% /trait|%`) then re-fetches each (EGS anticipated top 100, VNDB
  stats / schema / authinfo, upcoming collection + global, default
  tag/trait searches). Without the bust step the helpers would just
  read the still-fresh cache and `fetched_at` wouldn't move forward —
  which is why the button felt like a no-op before. Each task is a
  tracked job in the download status bar.

### Time-ago util ✅
`src/lib/time-ago.ts` — single source of truth for "X ago" formatting.
Tiers: minute (< 1 h) → hour (< 24 h) → day (< 7 d) → week (< 30 d) →
month (< 365 d) → year. Used by `RefreshPageButton`, `GameLog`, and
anywhere else relative time is needed. i18n keys in the `timeAgo.*`
group across all three locales.

### Localisation ✅
FR / EN / JA. Switch via the language pill in the top nav.

---

## Integrations

### VNDB Kana API v2 ✅
Read access for VN / character / staff / producer / tag / trait / quote /
release / ulist (wishlist). Token authentication for ulist.

### VNDB list write-back ✅
Status changes locally also `PATCH /ulist/<id>` against VNDB when a
token is set. Mapping (planning/playing/completed/on_hold/dropped →
5/1/2/3/4) is documented in [`src/lib/vndb-sync.ts`](src/lib/vndb-sync.ts).
Gated behind a `vndb_writeback` toggle in Settings — when unchecked,
local changes stay local. Best-effort: a 4xx / 5xx from VNDB is logged
but never rolls back the local state.

### VNDB → local status pull ✅
The reverse direction: Settings → "Pull statuses from VNDB" iterates
every predefined label (planning/playing/completed/on_hold/dropped) on
your VNDB ulist, picks the precedence-winning local Status per VN, and
applies it via `updateCollection`. Only touches VNs already in the local
collection — no silent imports. Returns a `{scanned, updated, unchanged,
skippedNotInCollection}` summary.

### ErogameScape ✅
SQL form scraping for scores, playtime medians, brand, genre, comments.
Typed `EgsUnreachable` error (network / server / throttled / blocked)
propagates to the UI so transient outages don't wipe matched rows.

### Steam playtime sync ✅
`/steam` pulls your Steam library via the Web API. Three sections:

  1. **Suggestions** — VN ↔ Steam pairs (auto + manual) where Steam
     time > local time. Tick rows + "Apply" merges via
     `updateCollection`, logging each jump in the activity table.
  2. **Saved links** — every persisted VN ↔ Steam mapping (auto or
     manual) with a per-row "unlink" button. Auto-detected links use
     VNDB release-level extlinks (the VN-level aggregator excludes
     Steam, so we batch-query `/release` with `extlink=steam` to
     resolve them). Manual links are *sticky* — a subsequent
     auto-scan won't overwrite them.
  3. **Unmapped Steam games** — every Steam game with playtime > 0
     that isn't linked yet. Type a title to fuzzy-search your
     collection then click a VN to bind the appid. The mapping
     persists to `steam_link(vn_id, appid, steam_name, source,
     last_synced_minutes)`.

Configure in Settings: Steam Web API key + 64-bit SteamID. The
collection-title search is exposed as `GET /api/collection/find?q=`
and is reusable elsewhere if needed.

### Anime adaptations ✅
Surfaces an "Anime adaptation" chip next to the action buttons on
`/vn/[id]` when VNDB's `has_anime` filter matches. Probed lazily on
first render and cached.

---

## Quality of life

### Drag-and-drop import ✅
Drop a `.json` or `.db` file anywhere on `/data` to trigger the import.

### Keyboard shortcuts ✅
| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Focus library search |
| `g h` | Go home |
| `g s` | Go to search |
| `g w` | Go to wishlist |
| `g r` | Go to recommendations |
| `?` | Open shortcut help |
| `Escape` | Close menus / dialogs |

### Grouped responsive navbar ✅
The top nav has four always-visible primary links (Library / Wishlist /
Lists / Search) plus three category dropdowns:
  - **Discover** — Upcoming, For you, Quotes
  - **Browse** — Producers, Series, Tags, Traits, Year, Labels
  - **Data & Stats** — Stats, Shelf, Steam, Data

The right edge carries the closed-eye content-controls hub, the
language switcher and the settings gear — all three remain visible
at every screen width. On screens narrower than `md` the rest of the
nav collapses into a single hamburger sheet that lists every
destination grouped by category.

### Tutorial tour ✅
First-time visitors get a guided pass over the most important surfaces
(library, search, VN detail, settings, stats). Re-runnable from
`/data → Tour`.

### Skeleton loading states ✅
Every async section renders a layout-matching skeleton while loading —
card grids show placeholder covers, row lists show shaded blocks, panels
show shimmer rectangles. Empty-state copy ("No results", "Nothing yet")
only appears after the fetch resolves with zero items, so the UI never
flashes "nothing here" when data is still in flight.

Internals: `src/components/Skeleton.tsx` exports `SkeletonBlock`,
`SkeletonCard`, `SkeletonCardGrid`, `SkeletonRows`, `SkeletonText`, and
`SkeletonTable`. Server components with slow async fetches wrap them in
`<Suspense>` (see `/upcoming` tabs and `/staff/[id]` extra credits).

### Viewport-aware lazy image loading ✅
`SafeImage` drives loading via `IntersectionObserver` (`rootMargin: 500px
0px`) instead of relying on native `loading="lazy"`. Native lazy-load
breaks subtly on grids inside overflow-scroll containers, transformed
parents, and SSR / hydration mismatches — symptom: images stay blank
while the user scrolls past. The observer-based approach starts the
network fetch when the element comes within 500 px of the viewport and
resets its state when the `src` changes, so recycled cards in
virtualised lists don't inherit a stale "errored" flag from the
previous VN.

Props: `priority?: boolean` skips the observer entirely for above-the-
fold imagery (VN detail hero, lightbox).

### Auto-recursive download (fan-out) ✅
When a VN is added or re-fetched, the app fans out in the background to
pull the full profile for every staff member, character, and developer
it credits (cached 30 days). So `/staff/[id]` / `/character/[id]` /
`/producer/[id]` open instantly with full data instead of waiting on a
fresh VNDB roundtrip.

Toggle in Settings → "Auto-download staff / characters / developers"
(default ON). When OFF, fan-out helpers exit early and VN downloads stay
fast.

### Selective full download ✅
On `/data`, a checkbox picker lists every VN in your collection with
**Select all** / **Select none** / **Invert** + a text filter. Tick the
VNs you want full data for and click "Run (N)" to queue the fan-out
for that subset only. Bypasses the auto-fan-out toggle since the user
is explicitly opting in. Drains through the global VNDB throttle so
large selections stay rate-limit-safe.

### VNDB rate limiter + 429 countdown ✅
`lib/vndb-throttle.ts` enforces 1 req/s globally + 60 s window for soft
circuit breaking. On 429 the failing request honors `Retry-After`
(capped at 60 s) and retries up to twice. Other callers stay on the
normal 1 req/s pace unless 3+ 429s pile up in 60 s.

The right-side `DownloadStatusBar` indicator shows a live countdown
banner whenever VNDB has asked us to wait — "VNDB returned 429,
retrying in 12s" — so you can see exactly when the next attempt will
fire. Same indicator surfaces per-job progress bars and per-item
errors (no more silent failures).

## Reading enhancement

### Pomodoro timer ✅
Detail-page widget — 25 min by default, configurable. On stop, prompt
to add the elapsed minutes to `playtime_minutes`. Always writes an
activity entry.

### Reading queue ✅
A priority queue distinct from the "Planning" status. Re-orderable via
drag; each entry shows the predicted reading time using the speed
estimator. Reflects on the home page above the library grid.

---

## Physical collection

### Box / location tagging ✅
`physical_location` as a free-form array per VN; each tag is filterable
on the home page.

### Owned-edition inventory ✅
`owned_release` table — one row per physical copy with condition, price,
currency, photos, dumped flag.

### QR labels (print view) ✅
`/labels?ids=…` prints a sheet of QR codes that point back to the VN's
detail page. Origin is derived from the incoming request headers so
labels work whatever port / LAN IP you're browsing. Tape them to your
boxes for instant lookup.

### Shelf visualisation ✅
`/shelf` lists every owned edition grouped by its first
`physical_location` tag (rows without a tag fall into "Unsorted").
Each card shows the cover, edition label, box type, condition,
dumped flag, and `price_paid`. The header sums totals per currency
and per location.

### Insurance / value tracking ✅
Same `/shelf` page — `owned_release.price_paid` + `currency` per row,
running totals at the section heading + grand total in the page
header. JSON / CSV export of the whole collection (including these
fields) lives in `/data → Exports`.

## Localisation

All UI strings live in `src/lib/i18n/dictionaries.ts`. The shape is
enforced via `Widen<typeof dictionaries['fr']>` so missing keys break
the build for FR / EN / JA. Adding a locale requires every key to be
filled.

EXISTS`, with marker rows in `app_setting` for one-shot data migrations
(e.g. EGS playtime hours → minutes, EGS id colon → underscore).
